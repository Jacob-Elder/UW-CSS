Multimedia Information Processing
====================


This course introduces techniques for processing and retrieval of multimedia data. The media to be considered include image, audio and video. At the end of this course, the students should have the expertise and competence to develop retrieval software for certain multimedia data.     

Brief Description: Currently, multimedia including image, video, and audio accounts for 60% of internet traffic, 70% of mobile phone traffic, and 70% of all available unstructured data. Multimedia data processing techniques are critically needed in applications ranging from entertainment, science, to education and business forecasting, to name a few.     

In this course, we will discuss multimedia data processing concepts and overview current approaches for multimedia data compression, indexing and retrieval. This course has both theoretical and practical components, where many basic concepts are illustrated through real-world multimedia applications. Students will also learn to apply multimedia data processing techniques to practical problems.
